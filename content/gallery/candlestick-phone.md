Don’t try to light this candlestick! It’s actually an upright phone from the
early 20th century with a mouthpiece at the top, handheld earpiece hanging off
the side, and a rotary dial at the base. Dmitri worked for Pacific Bell for
many years and was always interested in facilitating and restoring
communication, in old and new ways.


This phone now operates on spirit waves; feel free to dial a number and leave a spirit message. Make it irreverent; that’s how Dmitri would have done it!
