This 12” plush “Perfect Man” doll is dressed in perfect LL Bean and sports a cheesy grin and two thumbs up. He’s a funny reminder that often amused Dmitri and Tom. Press his left palm to hear what makes him so perfect! He spouts stereotypical platitudes like:

1. Mmmmm. You look so beautiful in the morning.
2. No, you don’t look at all fat in that dress. How could anything make you look fat?
3. Aw, can’t your mother stay another week?
4. Hello darling, have I told you I loved you lately?
5. Did you have a hard day, honey? Why don’t you sit down and let me rub your feet?
6. You’re going shopping by yourself? How about if I tag along and carry your bags?
7. Actually, I’m not sure which way to go. I’ll turn in here and ask directions.
8. I love you.
9. Yes, dear.
10. You’ve been on my mind all day. That’s why I’ve bought you these flowers.
11. You know, honey, why don’t you just relax and let me make dinner tonight?
