Two of Dmitri’s cartoon heroes were Fred Flintstone and Gumby. These two 8” tall bobble-top figurines ‘dance’ when you tap their heads. Fred was the inspiration for his and Tom’s historic house moving and home rental company, Rockhead & Quarry LLC, named after the quarry where Fred worked. Gumby plays a ukulele, one of Dmitri’s favorite instruments, while dancing the hula.
